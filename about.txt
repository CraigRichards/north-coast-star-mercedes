-- About --

James Mulholland started working with a Mercedes Benz Dealership in London in 1980 then started up James Leigh Mercedes in 1987 specializing in Mercedes servicing and repairs.

He worked at James Leigh Services until 2007 when he came to Australia. He started working for the Mercedes Benz Dealership on the Gold Coast and then in 2008 started up James For Mercedes Mobile for 2 years.

He then moved to a workshop in Southport, then in Hope Island and now at the current location in Helensvale with the latest special tools and Mercedes Diagnostic equipment.

Geoff Hughes is Jamesâ€™ business partner and provides another 30 years of experience on Mercedes after starting in 1987 and working in various Mercedes workshops.

As Mercedes Benz Independent Specialists we provide Mercedes Benz servicing, service indicator, reset log book/service book stamped and carry out Diagnostic Testing.

We like to think we can keep your Mercedes Benz on the road at a more affordable price.
